immortals of meluha    4.6/5   2201 reviews

1)WOW!! Really a great read! A fictional take on the life of Lord Shiva, the book is mesmerizing in its story and narration. It's almost like a bollywood movie as it has a love story, action, drama, humour and fiction blended in appropriate portions. Must read for anyone who wants an entertaining read!!

2)The book unfolds it's characters in the exact way that I love with switching between multiple time frames and characters to make it even more interesting and keepingâ€‹ the suspense till the very end before revealing it. And also not to forget the story telling by Amish. It's simply brilliant. Now let me buy the second book of this series and dive right into it.

3)Nice book

1 star

1)It started off well but went downhill as it went further. I am highly disappointed. This meaning not just this book but the entire trilogy looks more like a project trying to retrofit the stories to the modern sensibilities. No new perspective or research a la Devdutt Pattnaik. The anchronisms are jarring. Looks like the author has a Bollywood movie in sight and it feels like a screenplay for one. Writing a book is an art, it is story telling, it is perspectives, it is many things but an essay for a college project!

2)It is totally waste of money... childlike concept...all characters are belongs to shiva but represented fictionally... reading it is a waste of time...if someone loves reading books casually they can definitely go for it...

3)Worst book

helpful review

There isn't any word which can describe the awesomeness of this book...this book is so amazingly written that Many a time I felt as if I was watching a movie rather than reading a book... The characters came alive for me. .. As if they have risen from the book and the plot is being played in front of my eyes... An indispensable book for any book lover...

The secret of Nagas

 
5 star 
1)The second book in the Shiva Trilogy series. Must say again, I'm impressed with the quality of the work, research employed to help the readers understand the importance of Hindu mythology in India especially. The realm of our country has countless stories to offer, only for mankind to cherish and walk on the better path of life.
Everyone should definitely read this book once in a while.

2)I had already read this book twice before I bought it from Amazon. This is a book that is worth buying if only because it is a sequel to one of the best beginners to a trilogy : The Immortals of Meluha.
If we consider only this book, it is still a good one but doesn't match the standards of the first one. But i appreciate the effort and research the author has put in writing this sequel.

3)I really love the book and it's chara. The best thing about the novel is there way the achetectural designs have been explained I read it once and it is forever part of my memory castle.

1 star

1)Its not up to mark
Looking writer has read all the mythology books at once and trying to mix them.......
Nt a single incident is unforgettable
Seems its success is due to writers management fundamentals...... not for his writing skills.

2)Waste of time ... read other books based on Shivas real life but don't invest on this fiction of Amis

3)The author is confused and does not have clear vision of naga race


helpful review

This is the 2nd book of the Shiva trilogy. The story is the realisation of what the evil is and the preparation of war against the evil. The secrets of the nagas is actually that shiva finds out what truly the nagas are and it negates the general perception and how the nagas become an ally of Shiva. The factors that make this an excellent read is the way the war scenes are described. Also the love story of Shiva and Sati is so beautifully shown. The third point is the female characters that are depicted in this book are really strong characters be it Sati or Kali. It is a very entertaining read you will definitely love it. And as this is a part of a series you should definitely read the first and the third part too otherwise you will not be able to enjoy the story completely. Go for it. HAPPY READING

oath of vayuputras  1424    4.4/5
 
 5 star
 
 1)The third book & the final installment in the Shiva Trilogy series. In fact, I've purchased earlier but had gifted it to my mom. Now this time around I've took it for my own. Must say, I'm impressed with the quality of the work, research employed to help the readers understand the importance of Hindu mythology in India especially. The realm of our country has countless stories to offer, only for mankind to cherish and walk on the better path of life.
Everyone should definitely read this book once in a while.
The perfect ending, climax as anticipated from this masterpiece.

2)This is the 3rd part of the Shiva trilogy. And this shows the war towards the destruction of evil by Lord Shiva. But this doesn't come without a big loss for Shiva. I won't tell you what since it will spoil the book for you. But mark my words when this book will end you will not be able to control your emotions of anger and sadness. The story ends with evil being destroyed. And the fresh start of life. This is the conclusion of a magnum opus. This series is going to stay with you forever. Just like the previous two books the description of the war scenes are awesome. You should read this. HAPPY READING.

3)Widely known story of Dhaakshayani told in a different beautiful way . I would like to point out a few things , though.

Lord Manu was a famous Chola king in Tamilnadu. Not a Pandya king.

Bhagwad gita is referred to in some places in this book. But I assume the period of this book to be before the period of Mahabharata.


1 star

1)Nothing to do with the author, but i did not like the book at all. It was very boring.

2)Amish finished the book in time and got huge money bags.
But readers became fools after spending hard earned 200 rupees

3)Quality was not upto the mark

helpful review

This is the longest book I will ever reading without losing any enthusiasm.
I am actually an atheist now, after spending many years in worshiping God. But Amish felt the other way round, as he finally found his God, Shiva.
I bow low to Amish in respect, for his effort in creating this great book.
Anyone can write a story like 'Everyone has a Story', but not everyone can create larger than life characters like Amish, simultaneously expounding the valour of Indian mythology and how it can help us live a better life !

The mahabharat secret   4/5   671 reviews

5 star

1)A book which keeps you engaged with the characters till you complete it. One cannot resist reading the whole book once started.

Writer has tried to embed few chapters in between which take a break from the present day story(main part of the book) and deal with the historical era. That story break is something which everyone might not like(I have skipped those chapters sometimes just to continue with the present day story of the book)

2)I'm reading this again after 2 years(earlier i borrow the book from my friend now i own it :D ) & the thrill i experienced after reading this is still same as it was 2 years ago.
Christopher C. Doyle has done an amazing job with this book. A logical explanation to all the mystical weapon of the epic Mahabharta.

3)This one is the first book I started reading of Mr. Doyle and was lucky enough to meet him as well, which made me more engrossed in this book. Each chapter you move on, you feel like you are part of the story in solving the clues. Best part is you think something coming up in next chapter and you get surprised by something completely different. This made me more curious and kept reading. Wonderful writing, awesome plotting and The Secret of Nine..!!! Happy to be part of Quest Club..!!!


1 star

1)Writer has only utilized the name of 'MAHABHARATA' and 'SECRET' in the title of book however this book has no relations with MAHABHARATA. While I decided to buy this book I thought this must be related to 'MAHABHARATA'. The book title mislead me to buy it. The story writing is very poor

2)Waste of time. Nothing but a treasure hunt story.. Appears like copied from any Hollywood film and given the name of Mahabharata and Ashoka.. Nothing worth interesting. Pale narrations and irrelevant characters.. ! Don't buy.

3)don't buy


helpful review

Firstly, I would like to appreciate the author for his great research done. The plot and the selection of the historic events was awesome and accurate as the Mauryan and post Mauryan events have near accurate records of the historical events in India and the Pre Mauryan events have no proper records and if they exist, they are not vivid enough to get a clearer picture.

Sita-warrior of mithila  4/5 1453 reviews

5 star

1)Amish does make the drama in this wonderful mythology very interesting and real.
Also the character of sita is inspiring and the tale told leaves us awed and entertained.
Takes us to the realms of myths converting to real possibilities and makes us realise the strengths and depth of each characters.
And even though we know the Mythology by heart, amish has skilfully made it to make us feel the moments on the edge, with suspense and thrill.
Wonderful book for pop culture mythologies.

2)Another wonderful read.
Sita, Warrior of Mithila, gives you an interesting and unexpected storyline, right from the start of the book. I found this one much better in terms of the plot and the philosophies shared, than in Scion of Ikshvaku.

3)Compared to the 1st book, this book is an eye opener from the perspective of Sita. The timelines are intertwined regarding the 1st and the 2nd book of this series, only the perspective changes. Whereas the 1st book was more on the lines of the Meluha trilogy, the author Amish Tripathi has strove in this book, to do the same with a twist that keeps the readers engaged and wanting more.. Keep it up, Amish!! Salivating for the next - Raavan fromthe demon king's perspective!!


1 star

1)An absolute let down. Read the first chapter of Sita and you can very well put it down and wait for book 3. Large parts of it are exactly the same as Scion.. They haven't even bothered to reword it, you have to skip through paras to find new content. The fresh writing too is just repetition of the same ideologies as explained in the first book. The story doesn't move any further. Really disappointing

2)There is some difference between imagination and mythology. Amish has written this book based on sheer his imagination. A book can't be called a mythological book if you just mention some important and famous names .. Being myself from Mithila (the land of Sita), I don't like this book.

3)Amish has lost the track and now he is writing anything from folk tails or any thing which doesn't go well with the topic. Waste of money and time

helpful review

Amish started with Meluha and bang, it was amazing read. Although he lost some touch after first book itself still his books are way better in quality than many other Indian Authors (Bestselling authors).
I finished this book within a fortnight. It was good read, better than first book 'Scion of Iskvayu'. It indeed brings out many characteristics of Sita's upbringing in new light.
The book delivered by Amazon was well packaged, received a good quality book, nice font size, lightweight
