I was a little worried that I would be disappointed because I was looking forward to it so much. I finished it this morning and if anything, I was too reserved in my excitement. It is exactly the kind of sweeping fantasy that I love, and it has so many layers that give it much deeper meaning. I hate spoilers, so all I will say about the plot is that",
