photo graphy exposure

5 star

1)If you're just starting out at more advanced photography than point and click, this very brief guide is a good start at exposure. There is a lot more to exposure than this, to say the least, but if you read this from zero knowledge and practice, practice, practice, you're almost certain to benefit.

As with all such books, you'll get a lot more out of it if you pull your camera out while you're reading and experiment at the same time, so you can see exactly what the results look like. Since the book doesn't have any illustrations, this is especially important

2)very usfeul for beginners. to learn basics
3)good book





1 star

1)This book should have been called photography 101. It is basically definitions of what aperture , shutter and ISO are. There is no in-depth info at all about the art of exposure. No examples of how to shoot in snow or at the beach or in unusual situations. Not a piece of info I did not already know.

2)I suggest you to go for a better book

3)not recommended for beginners

photogrpaghy for beginners exposed

5 star

1)I am just getting into photography and recently purchased a Canon. Being a beginner, I wanted a book that would teach me how to use my camera to get the best shots possible. There are some great tips and tricks in here that I have not heard of before. The book goes over how to take a great photo in a variety of settings. My favorite part was the chapter on using natural light to create amazing images because it really does make a huge difference. Great book for beginners interested in photography.

2)Photography for Beginners Exposed is just the book I needed to read. Seeing as I suck a taking pictures! Lol

This book give quality information that's easy to make happen. Straight forward and to the point is just how i like it.

It was the ISO the was really throwing me for a loop on my camera settings.

Reed cleared that up for me and now I'm taking "ok" pictures!

An great Introductory book for people looking to get their feet wet with cameras!

3)This book is a very basic guide to photography. It covers the basics of the camera and it's accessories in a simplified manner and offers a few basic tips to get you started taking pictures. Read this one first if you are an absolute beginner. Then advance quickly to the many other books available that are a little more advanced to learn photography.

1)This is a very brief book that will literally take you eleven minutes to read (Kindle estimate). So it is really not worth the money. It is extremely basic, but not very well written.

the photographer's coach

5 star

1)Very well-written! Highly recommended if you are looking for inspiration and help in firming up direction for a career in photography. Not necessarily for beginning photographers but if you know the basics pretty well and are interested in taking photography to a more professional level, this is really great.

As an amateur transitioning to pro, this really spoke directly to my current situation and addressed many of my concerns!

2)A very inspired compilation on inspiration, vision and skill to the best photographs. With exercises that help you to generate new ideas and boost thecniques. In an accessible language,it pushes you to make some photos, almost immediately. I liked it a lot.

3)While most books on photography focus on camera controls and technical information, this brief book provides workable exercises to improve the quality of your work. It contains no magic answers, no silver bullets, but rather provides penetrating questions for each photographer to examine for her or himself. Think of it as a self-improvement workbook. I have no doubt that my inspiration, vision and skills will improve as I work through the exercises presented in this book.

1 star

1)Being new to photography, I was looking for some more direct instruction. Most of what's in here is asking you to ask yourself specific questions and self-assess specific things--all of which is great, but it didn't feel like it was worth purchasing a reading a whole book just for that. The suggestion to not only focus on skills was helpful, but again, not worth a whole book about.

2)Was this book a disappointment! Come on, this was easy earned money for the author. Next time, write a book: The money makers coach, how to make as little as possible for the dollar.

3)not worth

photography lighting

5 star

1)I found the discussion and tips here useful and fairly easy understand as well as to apply in my own photography efforts. The one thing I would have found even more useful in this book was a diagram of the various lighting setups and then an example or two of the results afterwards. In the meantime, I will have to do these myself for my own lighting notebook.

2)Fine as usual

complete beginners guide for photography

5 star

1)Photography is one of the best activity I love. However, making some enhancements through Photoshop gives me a lot of struggle. I tried to watch couple of videos in Youtube but still unable to learn everything. Thus, this book provides great tips for the beginners.I love the illustrations provided by the author. It makes me appreciate more. This book provides great tips to add beauty on your photos.

2)I love photography and this book is my first book on photography. I can frankly declare that this book is very educational and a great way to orient yourself in order to learn how to use a camera properly and how to use photoshop. It also describes different types of photo editing techniques. This book is basic guide on this topics and perfect for beginners. I would surely recommend this book for photography lovers. Thanks to Edward Bailey for his nice job.

3)The first thing that made my buy this book was its cover. I really feel the emotions expressed in the cover art. The book gives details about choosing the right color spectrum, ISO, lock catch, light diffuser and camera storage. It is good book for newbies who want to understand the perspective of taking exotic photos. It also have some quick tricks to use the camera flash for your advantage.

1 star

1)This is not a book and definitely not worth the money! This is nothing more than a glorified pamphlet! Do not waste your money!

2)Besides the content, I was expecting a book and its more like a booklet of 20 pages or something. Got it as a xmas present for someone and was very disapointed

3)not worth

helpful rerview

We all have cameras nowadays, but that doesn't make everyone a photographer. I appreciated this book because it gave basic camera information that was applicable to not only fancy DSLRs, but also for the camera I carry around with me everyday. This book will enhance you and guide you how to get a good shot when taking a picture. It contains also a tips and guide that will help you to improve you skills when it comes to photography.

photography by steve royce


5 star

1)This was a really informative book. As soon as I finished reading it, I grabbed my cameras and immediately went out to shoot.... Steve Royce is a good writer. Nothing boring here. Concise, clear and great tips. You MUST read this book!!!

2)I am new to photography and this book was helpful. Not on how to work the settings on a camera but what to keep in mind when taking photos.

3)Read this as an introduction to digital photography if you've not done it before. Then go out and study any of the other basic photography books. Finally, do what this author says, "Go out and experiment." It is the best way to learn your equipment and your craft.

digital photography made easy

5 star

1)'m an amateur snapper.
I love taking photos and I have a wonderful camera that came with a little book that tells me how to use it, it might as well be written in Chinese. However, this little book gave me all the basic info on how to take great photos and I could understand it!
I could easily implement the instructions and build on them. This book is not for pros or advanced, yet a real helper for beginners!

2)As an amateur photographer, I picked up some new stuff from this book as it guided me through the use of standard lens and showed me how to capture nice photos. Although short, but the facts are straight to the point and clearly explained. For a beginner, this book comes across as easy to understand. Probably just requires practice to get a better grasp of the camera.

3)This book has some advantages over some other big, long books. The author mentions only the surface and most important things someone needs to know in order to start taking nice pictures fast. This book has helped understand the basic about the camera's part and functions. Now, I would not be ignorant on how and when to use a specific function.

1 star

1)I would feel cheated if I had not gotten this free. It is still bad enough I felt compelled to write a review.

There are many grammatical errors and technical error (larger f stop numbers are not larger apertures). The advice is contradictory and somewhat trite. There are many instances of do this but doing the opposite may work too.

2)this book isn't even as good as generic web sites about photography. i bought the kindle version and it didn't even have any pictures. do your self a favor and just google "photography tips", you'll certainly find better information than this book contained.

3)waste of time

helpful review

I really love photography! This book serves best for beginners who wants to learn photo capturing. It explains well the step by step guide you all need as a beginner on this. Exactly! This is what I really need. Like me who loves photography yet a little confused if they are doing it correctly. Now, I highly recommend to those who want learn photography, try this book!
